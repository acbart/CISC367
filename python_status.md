- *Variables, types, values, assignment: expert* I think? The 108 curriculum has been burned into my brain at this point, so that explains a lot of my answers I think
- *Lists: expert* again I think. I feel really comfortable iterating, subscripting, etc.
- Dictionaries: also expert I think, especially with mixing different types and lists in dictionaries and lists of dictionaries
- *Sets: unfamiliar* I know and understand sets as a concept but have never coded with them.
- *Tuples: I know they exist and what they look like.* I don't know how or why to use them over lists. 
- *Basic operators: Expert I think?*
- *Strings and string operations: Expert*, I know how to use string methods, subscript, etc. 
- *Conditionals/If statements: Expert*
- *While Loops: Proficient*, I am more familiar in Java than I am in Python, but I am expert in Java
- *For loops: Expert* in both for-each and traditional for loops
- *List comprehensions: Familiar*, I've seen this many times but have never actively used it 
- *Functions: Expert*
- *Classes and Objects: Expert in Java, unfamiliar in Python*
- *Importing modules: Expert I think* I know how to import part of a module, full module, some "as"
- *Using the unittest module and writing assertions: Familiar,* I'm more experienced with cisc108 assertEquals, but I've used more like `assertTrue()` and other variations in CISC181
- *File handling: Familiar*, just 108 F2020 stuff though
- *Regular expressions: Completely unfamilar*
- *Exception handling (try/except): Completely unfamiliar*
- *Decorators: Completely unfamiliar*
- *Lambdas: Completely unfamiliar*
